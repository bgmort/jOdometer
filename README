jOdometer is a counter that works like an odometer: moving the numbers up like in a wheel.
This is a fork of Jesus Carrera's image based counter.  Instead of images, it uses plain
HTML, so it can easily be styled with CSS.

We can configure:

* Start number
* Stop number
* Delay between the number change
* Increment units
* Speed and easing of the animation
* Whether to format large numbers with comma or not.
* Whether leading zeros should be visible or hidden.

We can also update the numbers manually/dynamically.
